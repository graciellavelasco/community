# Project Overview
 What does the word "community" mean to me? It's something that can bring people together or feeling a sense of belonging in a big group. The community project lead me to think about what would best desribe this feeling. Therefore, I thought it would be best expressed through a song.

 The website I have created features lyrics that contain animations that play on the words of the song. The song I have chosen is called Lemonade by Jeremy Passion. This song represents the "Fil-Am anthem" which brings a lot of Filipino Americans together. It is also commonly known as a "simp" song, meaning romantic. Building this website was quite difficult as I explored different kinds of CSS styles.
